See the end for copying conditions.

This directory contains sources for a library which provides
routines to manipulate the structures used for the client end
of Microsoft NTLM authentication.

This code was initially taken mostly from the Samba project and was
initially intended for use with Microsoft Exchange Server when it is
configured to require NTLM authentication for clients of it's IMAP
server.  Today, libntlm contain re-written code, so that the license
is now LGPL instead of the GPL that would be inherited from the Samba
files.

Build instructions are in INSTALL.  Typically, the following is
sufficient:

 $ ./configure
 $ make
 $ make check
 $ make install

USAGE  
  
The application program must convert these structures to/from
base64 which is used to transfer data for IMAP authentication.
For example usage see the sources for the mutt MUA or the
fetchmail package.

In general the usage is something like shown below (no, I don't
know if this code even compiles, but you get the idea
hopefully):


#include <ntlm.h>

extern char *seqTag;  /* IMAP sequence number */

int imap_auth_ntlm(char *user, char *domain, char *pass)
{
  tSmbNtlmAuthRequest   request;              
  tSmbNtlmAuthChallenge challenge;
  tSmbNtlmAuthResponse  response;
  char buffer[512];
  char tmpstr[32];
  
  writeToServer("%s AUTHENTICATE NTLM\r\n",seqTag);
  readFromServer(buffer)
  
  /* buffer should be "+", but we won't show code to check */

  /* 
   * prepare the request, convert to base64, and send it to
   * the the server.  My server didn't care about domain, and NULL
   * worked fine.
   */

  buildSmbNtlmAuthRequest(&request,user,domain);
  convertToBase64(buffer, &request, SmbLength(&request));
  writeToServer("%s\r\n",buffer);
  
  /* read challange data from server, convert from base64 */
  
  readFromServer(buffer);
  
  /* buffer should contain the string "+ [base 64 data]" */
  
  convertFromBase64(&challenge, buffer+2);
  
  /* prepare response, convert to base64, send to server */
  
  buildSmbNtlmAuthResponse(&challenge, &response, user, pass);
  convertToBase64(buffer,&response,SmbLength(&response));
  writeToServer("%s\r\n",buffer);
  
  /* read line from server, it should be "[seq] OK blah blah blah" */
  
  readFromServer(buffer);
  
  sprintf(tmpstr,"%s OK",seqTag);
  
  if (strncmp(buffer,tmpstr,strlen(tmpstr)))
  {
    /* login failed */
    return -1;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
