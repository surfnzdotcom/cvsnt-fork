	  revision to/from the base directory during update_entries() an
	  option --antivirus.  This may be needed on commit, but I've made
	  it a global option.  CVS4S may need this set too!

	* src/client.cpp: one customer is experiencing a problem with fiels
	  changing permissions after commit (in conjunction with cvs edit
	  -A) which we just cannot reproduce - so this is an attempt to
	  'work around' it by using the edit/unedit code.  If this works it

	  Note: the expand_keywords and associated trigger is now called
	  even if the file is marked kb or ko but only called once with the
	  keyword $None$ - this is to enable the author to be passed to the
	  triggers (for each file) - I'm knind of surprised that it's not
	  already possible to get this from commitlog.	Author belongs on
	  the file not the session since one day we may support multiple
	  authors in a single session (ie: cvs4s using the owner of the
	  file as the author).

	* cvsapi/XmlNode.cpp, cvsapi/XmlNode.h, libxml/elfgcchack.h,
	  libxml/globals.c, libxml/xmlmemory.c: Try and find out why
	  xmlFree() fails to link on HPUX.  At first I thought this was
	  just due to threading - but it is also that when threading is
	  disabled then xmlFree() is just #defined to free() which is
	  dynamically loaded through the c-runtime.  HPUX has a fit if you
	  try and mix dynamic and static libraries this way
	  (app->sharedlib->staticlib is OK), so I'm defining a nice

	  to link on HPUX.  Statically link the same source for win32 as we
	  use for mac / redhat es v4 / hpux etc.  The problem with linking
	  on HPUX appears to be the same as with linking statically on
	  windows - mixing threaded and non-threaded libraries.  So I've
	  disabled the thread support in the xmlversion.h file (which will
	  work for windows, but I think hpux/linux will re-generate it -
	  which may not be so good..., but I'll try this first...).

	  tracing that is being removed has been here for years and some

	* src/: rcs.cpp, server.cpp: some extra debugging to try and find
	  how the client receives a checkout (which runs quickly)

2008-05-15 14:15  abarrett

	* ChangeLog, build.h: Build 2.5.03.3082

2008-05-15 13:51  abarrett

	* src/: buffer.cpp, buffer.h, client.cpp, server.cpp: Bug5274:
	  write network faster by avoiding use of the buffer for >10MB.
	  Use windows memory functions on windows (can be disabled).  Extra
	  debugging of client send and server receive (of commit).  Server
	  now free's memory when receiving 'large chunk'.  Client should
	  end up using less memory (I hope).  It does compile but that is
	  about all I am sure of.

2008-05-15 12:27  abarrett

	* src/: checkout.cpp, modules.cpp, server.cpp: Bug5279 - try and
	  handle modules file 'module -d .

2008-05-15 10:14  abarrett

	* ChangeLog, build.h: Build 2.5.03.3081

2008-05-15 09:36  abarrett

	* windows-NT/win32.cpp: Bug5274: better reporting of /3GB mode - no
	  longer 'assumes' that server os needs 512Mb and client OS needs
	  384Mb, uses current allocated physical memory instead which
	  accounts for other processes running on the server much better.

2008-05-15 09:27  abarrett

	* src/server.cpp: Bug5274: write committed file on server as one
	  large 'chunk' rather than lots of small(er) writes to see if this
	  improves performance.  Can be disabled with WriteOnce=0 in
	  /etc/cvsnt/PServer or in the windows registry.

2008-05-15 09:03  abarrett

	* src/: diff.cpp, patch.cpp, rcs.cpp, server.cpp, update.cpp: add
	  extra debugging - find what 'diff' is doing to the memory, and
	  trace better where it is called from.

2008-05-15 07:52  abarrett

	* installer/combined-license.rtf: update license to reflect new
	  name for workspacemanager

	  should be that the client and/or server will warn you before
	  trying to commit a large file that it will run out of memory

2008-05-13 16:26  abarrett

	* src/server.cpp: Bug5274: try and use windows native file handles

	  an excuse as any why it'd be behaving this way.

	  libtool grief since it goes looking for .deps/../ufc-crypt/etc

	  So this is a miserably hack to at least get it compiling.

	  If it works I then propose going back and altering the .vcproj to
	  'point' to the files in cvsapi/ufc-crypt and leave the .vcproj
	  itself in the orig location, probably would need to fix the
	  Makefile in the root as well...

	* src/recurse.cpp: more rename debugging.  Still no bug number for
	  this.

	  Revision to Problem Definition:

	  Under some test sets no .directory_history is created.  After a
	  commit following a rename.  The CVS/Rename directory is removed
	  on the client indicating the commit/rename went OK, but no
	  .directory_history file has been created in the repo.

	  I've gotten as far as determining that walklist (dirlist,...) is
	  not called: in do_recursion() [around line 961] because dirlist
	  is NULL.

	      do_recursion: cannot process the directories (dirlist ==
	  NULL)

	  dirlist should NOT be null since the output included in the
	  output: cvs commit: Examining .  cvs commit: Examining test5
	  Checking in test5/New2.sas;
	  /myrepo/CVSSDLC/SAS/Define/test5/Original2.sas,v  <--  New2.sas
	  new revision: 1.4; previous revision: 1.3 done

	  So now I'm trying to find out why addlist(dirlist) is not doing
	  what we expect it to do... (do_dir_proc() is not called so that's
	  not the reason)

	* src/: mapping.cpp, recurse.cpp: more rename debugging.  Still no
	  bug number for this.

	  Problem is that under some test sets no .directory_history is
	  created after a commit following a rename.  The CVS/Rename
	  directory also remains on the client indicating some sort of
	  error that is not reported to the user.

	  Still just trying to debug and find out where the code is
	  exiting...

	* cvsapi/cvs_string.h: Bug5002: oracle 8/9 support - fix compile
	  warnings on Windows

2007-11-02 15:43  abarrett

	* cvsapi/: cvs_string.cpp, cvs_string.h: Bug5002 (oracle 8/9
	  support)

	  This adds support for 'real' UCS2 strings (4 byte fixed) to
	  cvsnt.  I've only tested these with Oracle (both 8 and 9) and
	  since Oracle doesn't complain then I assume I've got this all
	  correct (I went through plenty of iterations where I got oracle
	  to crash with bad data - so this is a reasonable assumption...)

	* cvsapi/SqlRecordset.cpp:
	  Bug5002 (oracle 8/9 support), but really these are just changes

	* cvsapi/unix/: RunFile.cpp, SocketIO.cpp: Bug5002 (oracle 8/9

	* cvsapi/db/oracle/: OracleConnection.cpp, OracleConnection.h,
	  OracleConnectionInformation.cpp, OracleConnectionInformation.h,
	  OracleRecordset.cpp, OracleRecordset.h: Bug5002: Oracle 8/9
	  Support

	  Tested only on HPUX 11.11

	  Known Bugs: commit message (and other nclob) fields are not
	  correctly handled - which means "long" messages and diffs will
	  fail to be stored in CommitLog table.

	* src/add.cpp, src/entries.cpp, src/hash.cpp, src/hash.h,
	  src/main.cpp, src/subr.cpp, windows-NT/win32.cpp: OK here is part
	  2!  BUILD 2733.

	  New settings: - AllocMax2=262144 - AllocThreshold=0 (use "big
	  block of memory" if lines >= AllocThreshold) - EntriesLineCount=0

	  These settings are purely debug: - TestSpeed1=0 - PerformFind=1

	  To disable "big block of mem" do one or both: - AllocMax2=0 -
	  AllocThreshold=0 (ie: it is off by default currently)

	  Note: If EntriesLineCount=0 (the default) the assumed line count
	  is 1, which in turn enables "big block of mem" if AllocThreshold
	  is any value above 0.

	  If AllocMax2 is a value other than zero, then that amount of
	  memory will be allocated in one go at the beginning of
	  Entries_Open and released in Entries_Close.  That memory is then
	  used by all the hash routines that work on lists and nodes,
	  including strdup's so that memory is not constantly fetched (also
	  potentially stops fragmentation of memory).

	  This is basically designed to stop CVSNT Server thrashing the
	  memory allocation routine.

	  The actual "bug" that was causing the slowdown was bug4804 -
	  having the check for "use windows native memory" in subr
	  xmalloc() in combination with the number of times that
	  Entries_Open calls xmalloc() was just a disaster.

	  The latest 4964 patch checks the setting of "use windows native
	  memory" at startup in main() and that is all.  However all these
	  perf changes may result in an improvement - but I've ensured they
	  are now all off by default, in particular: - HeapCreate2=0 -
	  EntriesLineCount=0 - TestSpeed1=0 - PerformFind=1 -
	  HeapSerialize=1

	  For maximum performance of add (and entries function generally,
	  eg: edit) set these: - HeapCreate2=1 - HeapSerialize=0 -
	  AllocThreshold=1 - ListCacheSize=8192, - NodeCacheSize=16384

	  Optionally you can set: - HeapInitial to a value > 262144 -
	  EntriesLineCount=1 - AllocThreshold to a value > 1 (eg: 128)

2004-10-23 04:40  tmh

	* installer/: cvsnt.wxs, wincvs.wxs: Slightly more logical ordering

2004-10-23 03:59  tmh

	* installer/: WinCvs.iss, build_wincvs.bat, cvsnt.wxs, wincvs.wxs:

	  encoding conversions and resource fork handling, using code
	  originally developed in cvsgui project (cvsgui.sf.net)

2004-10-20 11:00  tmh

	* installer/: build.bat, cvsnt.wxs, cvsnt_client.wxs,
	  cvsnt_server.wxs: MSI is too simplistic (and at the same time as
	  being ridiculously overcomplicated... gotta love MS) to do the
	  CVSNT installer in the same way as innosetup does it, so I'll
	  have to dumb it down a lot.  Not sure now, though.

2004-10-20 06:34  tmh

2004-10-20 06:28  tmh

	* cvsnt.iss, installer/cvsnt.iss, installer/cvsnt.wxs: Add wix
	  installer to cvs tree, move iss to subdirectory

2004-10-20 06:21  tmh

	* lockservice/: lockservice.cpp, server.cpp: Fix the old problem
	  with the system tray falling over on the way out.  For some
	  reason something deep within the Win32 API falls over if you
	  return from the GUI thread, so I just for now I forcibly
	  terminated the app.

2004-10-20 06:00  tmh

	* contrib_nt/com_example/Class1.cs, src/infolib.h, src/server.cpp,

	  Call postcommit in correct place for COM interfaces otherwise
	  ICvsInfo2 doesn't work as expected.

	* lockservice/LockParse.cpp, src/client.cpp, src/commit.cpp,
	  src/cvs.h, src/lock.cpp, src/rcs.cpp: Handle a potential deadlock
	  (not too bad as it'll timeout anyway).  Use the brute-force
	  method of working around Norton... just keep trying (which isn't
	  guaranteed to work, even then...  better than nothing I guess).

2004-10-19 09:24  tmh

2004-10-19 08:15  tmh

	  Add W_FAKE to cope with fake trees

2004-10-07 14:05  tmh

	* src/: recurse.cpp: [no log message]

2004-10-07 13:53  tmh

	* src/recurse.cpp: is -n co worth this?  It doesn't even work in
	  cvs 1.x....

2004-10-07 13:43  tmh

	* src/recurse.cpp: Small fix to lock path

2004-10-07 13:34  tmh

	* ChangeLog: Sync up

2004-10-07 13:17  tmh

	* src/recurse.cpp: -n co again (this never worked before, so
	  probably isn't major).

2004-10-07 12:37  tmh

	* cvsntcpl/: advancedpage.cpp, advancedpage.h: Apply on editchange

2004-10-07 12:12  tmh

	  windows-NT/filesubr.cpp, windows-NT/win32.cpp: Handle case
	  normalisation where it's needed (at the lockserver interface) so

	* src/: edit.cpp, fileattr.cpp, fileattr.h: Some tracing for
	  unedit, and make sure it cleans up properly (was assuming the
	  user only had an edit on one branch).

	  unedit probably should be branch specific by default.. the code
	  can do it with minor tweaks but it's not really a servicepack
	  issue for now.

2004-10-06 11:14  tmh

2004-08-16 01:36  tmh

	  implemented yet).

2004-08-15 11:15  tmh

	* lib/system.h, src/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.in, src/cvs.h: Make

2004-08-15 06:01  tmh

	* src/: cvs.h, fileattr.cpp, lsacl.c, perms.cpp, recurse.cpp:

	  to be able to specify these (no longer xpath compatible but well
	  whatever...)

2004-08-14 22:30  tmh

	* src/fileattr.cpp, src/perms.cpp, windows-NT/config.h,

	  filter.

2004-08-14 21:25  tmh

	* src/perms.cpp: VC giving a syntax error... been starting at it
	  for half an hour now and can't see the problem, so going to try

2004-08-14 04:49  tmh

	  Untested.  Not sure what to do with the default ACLs really (even
	  whether to keep them).

2004-08-13 00:33  tmh

	* doc/cvs.dbk: Update docs - split extnt to a new sect2, and remove
	  old reference to CVS_PASSFILE

2004-08-12 23:34  tmh

	* src/: checkin.cpp, cvs.h, perms.cpp, rcs.cpp, tag.cpp: Stub/wipe
	  all the old perms checking.  Best to start from scratch rather
	  than hack the existing stuff.  Since I've got a personal deadline
	  of Sunday  to get this working I'd better get moving...  Add
	  verify_tag right & put it in the tag code.

2004-08-12 03:01  tmh

	* configure: break RH sserver/gsserver so every other OS still
	  works

2004-08-12 02:58  tmh

	* configure.in, redhat/cvsnt.spec: All the RH fixes now mean it
	  doesn't compile correctly on any other architecture.	Better to
	  break RH.

2004-08-12 02:30  tmh

	* redhat/cvsnt.spec.in: Over an hour for an OS that is <0.1% of
	  usage.  No comment.

2004-08-12 02:14  tmh

	* redhat/cvsnt.spec.in: FFS am I going to have to go through this
	  every time I want to release an RPM???

2004-08-12 02:01  tmh

	* redhat/cvsnt.spec.in: ANOTHER redhat fix.  Close to giving up on
	  the RPM

2004-08-12 01:34  tmh

	* acinclude.m4, aclocal.m4, configure: More RH9 fixes.	I'm not
	  sure if this is going to work. If not I'll forget redhat sserver
	  support.

2004-08-12 01:00  tmh

	* configure, configure.in, protocols/ntlm/ntlm.h,
	  redhat/cvsnt.spec: RH9 fixes.  It's fairly broken w/kerberos and
	  openssl so we've got to munge the config file to cope with it

2004-08-11 23:46  tmh

	* ChangeLog: Update changelog

2004-08-11 10:34  tmh

	* src/rcs.cpp: Narrow down scope of pmode

2004-08-11 10:21  tmh

	* src/: Makefile.am, Makefile.in, mkmodules.cpp, perms.cpp: Unix
	  compilation

2004-08-11 10:09  tmh

	* src/mkmodules.cpp, src/release.cpp, version_no.h: Remove some
	  merging from the main branch, and put the release stuff in just
	  in case a 51c ever makes it out of the door

2004-08-11 09:52  tmh

	* src/fileattr.cpp, windows-NT/win32.cpp: 'n' is an explicit deny
	  ACL on read/write/create/tag.  Use GetTokenInformation where
	  possible.

2004-08-11 09:04  tmh

	* src/add.cpp: Fix add directory

2004-08-10 11:30  tmh

	* protocols/sspi.cpp, windows-NT/win32.cpp: Should call
	  GetTokenInformation where possible (eg. when impersonating)
	  otherwise we end up needing privileges that ordinary users don't
	  have on an active directory.

	  Make SSPI return the authenticating domain and always use that.
	  This changes the effective usernames when using SSPI (since it
	  tends to include the domain).. need to work out in what
	  circumstances to change it back to maintain the old behaviour.

2004-08-10 10:14  tmh

	* src/perms.cpp, windows-NT/config.h, windows-NT/win32.cpp: Read
	  groups off system to supplement CVS groups.  perms check stubbed
	  out for now.

2004-08-10 01:04  tmh

	* cvsnt.vcproj, src/add.cpp, src/cvs.h, src/hash.cpp, src/hash.h,
	  src/perms.c, src/perms.cpp: Convert perms to cpp, and some
	  preliminary groups work.

2004-08-09 04:50  tmh

	* src/perms.c, windows-NT/run.cpp, windows-NT/win32.cpp: Read/write
	  directory owner from fileattr

2004-08-07 03:37  tmh

	* windows-NT/: win32.cpp: More debugging on domain stuff

2004-08-07 00:45  tmh

	* cvsntcpl/advancedpage.cpp, cvsntcpl/advancedpage.h,
	  cvsntcpl/cvsntcpl.rc, src/client.cpp, src/commit.cpp, src/cvs.h,
	  src/lock.cpp, src/main.cpp, src/mapping.cpp, src/rcs.cpp,
	  src/rename.cpp, src/server.cpp: Fix calculation of toplevel_repos
	  if using backslashes.

2004-08-06 11:11  tmh

	* src/: client.cpp, import.cpp, rcs.cpp, update.cpp: Always mask
	  mode with 0777 - client does this anyway but it's best not to
	  store the extra bits at all.

2004-08-06 10:11  tmh

	* src/: checkout.cpp, cvs.h, main.cpp, root.cpp, server.cpp,
	  subr.cpp: Some chroot fixes

	* diff/: context.c, diff.c, util.c: Some stuff to try to look at

2004-08-04 01:49  tmh

	* src/: cvs.h, fileattr.cpp: Make sure CVS directory exists before

2004-08-04 00:51  tmh

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.in, configure: Make Unix compile (doesn't
	  build static expat yet though).  Make chroot stuff work OK and
	  some code to handle the idea of the repository being in the new
	  root directory.

2004-08-03 21:06  tmh

	* doc/PServer.example, src/cvs.h, src/main.cpp, src/server.cpp:

2004-08-03 07:58  tmh

	* src/: add.cpp, edit.cpp, fileattr.cpp, fileattr.h, perms.c,
	  watch.cpp: Default attribute copying.  Parse .owner/.perms into
	  new attributes - may need tweaking as it's a good opportunity to
	  tidy up the semantics a bit.

	  Still using old perms code.  Next task.

2004-08-03 00:50  tmh

	* Makefile.in, configure, configure.in: Use convenience libtool

	  edit/watch.  Fix the temporary edits which don't look like
	  they've ever worked correctly.  Todo: 'cvs add' should copy the
	  default attributes to new files.  Merge in the perms stuff now we
	  have a flexible attributes system.

2004-08-01 21:18  tmh

	* src/release.cpp: Make release a bit more forgiving

2004-08-01 09:46  tmh

	* redhat/: cvsnt.spec, cvsnt.spec.in: Another spec update.  This
	  one is an RPM bug I think

2004-08-01 09:03  tmh

	* redhat/: cvsnt.spec, cvsnt.spec.in: You wouldn't think RPM was a
	  braindead as it is, but it seems to be utterly so

2004-08-01 08:45  tmh

	  script

2004-07-30 08:07  tmh

	* cvsservice/Service.cpp, lockservice/lockservice.cpp: Rollback a
	  couple of the service changes (the docs have dwWaitHint=0 which
	  should be 'forever' but obviously they're wrong)

2004-07-30 06:14  tmh

	* src/filesubr.cpp, windows-NT/filesubr.cpp, windows-NT/win32.cpp:
	  Pass xchmod through chmod again.  Does a lot of extra work but
	  it's the only way of getting the read/write bits correct.

2004-07-30 05:56  tmh

	* windows-NT/win32.cpp: Implement cygwin ntea support.	Ironically
	  cygwin no longer supports this... so it's by far the worse option
	  (you get permission preservation, but not the ability to
	  read/change them).

2004-07-28 20:16  tmh

	* src/fileattr.cpp: Fileattr writing.  Now to get the edit logic
	  working again.

	  windows-NT/filesubr.cpp, windows-NT/win32.cpp: More xpath-like
	  searching.  Now reads the status correctly (which is a start).
	  Avoid setting ACLs on files in CVSROOT.

2004-07-26 02:57  tmh

	* src/: add.cpp, checkin.cpp, commit.cpp, edit.cpp, fileattr.cpp,
	  fileattr.h, update.cpp, watch.cpp: Change calls to fileattr
	  routines, and create relevant stubs.	Search will need to be more
	  complex, but it's still quite simple.

2004-07-25 22:59  tmh

	* cvsnt.sln, cvsnt.vcproj, src/cvs.h, src/fileattr.cpp,

	* test_new.txt: [no log message]

2004-07-20 22:35  tmh

	* windows-NT/win32.cpp: Tidy up permissions fix.  Can't grant 'Full
	  Control' to owner as it isn't a permission bit but an exact
	  combination of bits.. so you get full control even if Windows
	  says you haven't got it...

2004-07-20 22:24  tmh

2004-07-19 21:13  tmh

	* version_no.h, protocols/sserver.cpp, windows-NT/win32.cpp: Give

2004-07-18 21:29  tmh

	* cvsservice/Service.cpp, lockservice/lockservice.cpp: Set service
	  descriptions.  Not particularly enlighnening (just the version
	  string) but better than nothing.

2004-07-17 13:27  tmh

	* cvsservice/Service.cpp, lockservice/lockservice.cpp: Set load
	  order.. speeds up booting somewhat and as cvsnt isn't an
	  essential service we can start up quite late in the sequence.

2004-07-16 10:09  tmh

	* src/: checkout.cpp, cvs.h, server.cpp, subr.cpp: Change directory
	  hack, which will basically allow absolute checkouts again (not
	  really, it's just doing what the user should have done in the
	  first place).  Output will be confusing in this case as we can't
	  tell the server of the real client directory - and nor should we,
	  just in case.

2004-07-16 09:07  tmh

	* src/: checkout.cpp, cvs.h, subr.cpp: Might as well remove all the
	  dir_replace stuff as it's not valid any more.

2004-07-16 05:56  tmh

	* src/find_names.cpp, src/main.cpp, src/mkmodules.cpp,

	  mode lockserver stuff)

	* cvsdelta/cvsdelta.cpp, cvsdelta/cvsdelta.h, src/rcs.cpp,

	  size can overrun a simplistic calculation.

	  Most of this code was written in a moment of brilliance at around
	  4am... absolutely no idea how it works any more so I'd rather not
	  do too much to it :)

2004-07-14 01:48  tmh

	  find_names.cpp, mapping.cpp, modules.cpp, rcs.cpp, recurse.cpp,
	  server.cpp, subr.cpp, update.cpp: Make upward relative pathnames
	  work by forcing the server to correct the client response
	  automatically (it's too late I think to start updating clients).
	  As written the server would walk all over the filesystem if you
	  specified enough '..' in a client... this is due to it sending
	  the repository root as its current directory instead of a
	  suitable subdirectory - there's nowhere safe to go upwards from
	  that directory.  The server works out a safe path and replaces
	  with that instead so everything works safely.  This turns out to
	  be critical for rename, which must always be located in the right
	  relative directory to do anything sensible.

2004-06-20 07:19  tmh

	* src/: client.cpp, server.cpp: Relative pathnames seem to work
	  today, but .. is really strange (and doesn't work with rename).
	  It creates random directories called 'd' in the temp folder then
	  completely fails to use them - this screws up rename as it
	  doesn't know what directory it's dealing with.  My gut feeling
	  tells me there's a fairly nasty security hole there too.  Need to
	  decouple completely the server and client directories before I'll
	  be happy with what's going on.

2004-06-19 09:25  tmh

	* src/client.cpp, src/mapping.cpp, src/recurse.cpp, src/root.cpp,

	  these should never have been allowed anyway (allowing them opens
	  a client-side security hole, plugged since 2.0.38, (so you now
	  get a confusing error instead of undefined behavour...) and are
	  blocked server-side by most operations so this really only
	  affects a few (update mainly, since commit was already covered).

	  Relative pathnames seem to be borked by the client/server rename.
	   Too tired to see what the problem is here (can't work it out) so
	  I'll look at that tomorrow.

	  for example it doesn't handle recursion at all so there are lots
	  of circumstances where your tags will just go byebye just because
	  you picked the wrong directory structure...  Really it should
	  stack them as it goes down an pop them on the way back up).

	  despite the fact that this contradicts the documentation, the
	  ...Ex version seems to be a cause of instability (in particular
	  the MachineName parameter, which if you don't set it causes a
	  null pointer exception, and if you do set it occasionally causes
	  a deadlock...)

	  Soak test of 10,000 logins seems to be OK so that's one source of

	  windows-NT/setuid/setuid/LsaSetuid.h,
	  windows-NT/setuid/setuid/setuid.cpp,
	  windows-NT/setuid/setuid/stdafx.h: Damned hard to find this one,
	  but under a checked build I found...

	  1. The documented way to generate a token
	  (LSA_TOKEN_INFORMATION_V1) is totally broken on XP - LSASS.EXE
	  tries to free the memory from the wrong heap and dies - this is
	  only actually documented on Google Groups, and not fixed even on
	  a fully patched XP... You have to use the undocumented
	  LSA_TOKEN_INFORMATION_V2 instead [It's sufficient to search for
	  the latter in Google to find the only documentation about this
	  bug].  2. S4U *is* implemented on XP, but it's disabled - it
	  bombs out early in its processing complaining that it's not
	  running on a server edition (XP Server == Win2003, basically) [a
	  possibly interesting aside to this is when the LSA heap is
	  corrupted by (1), then it sometimes fluffs the check and starts
	  looking for an Active Directory to do its validation with.. this
	  means I guess that the 'server/workstation' flag is in memory
	  somewhere, and if someone could find the right byte to write to
	  then you could re-enable server features like S4U on XP].
