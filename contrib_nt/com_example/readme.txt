This is a shell COM object.

To invoke it put its class ID to the CVSROOT/triggers file eg.

DEFAULT {A12DA672-74ED-3F65-B0B1-D6A73CA232BB}

Note that class ID will probably be different for you (and should be, if you want anyone else to
be able to use your object).

COM integration requires Windows NT/2000/XP/2003
