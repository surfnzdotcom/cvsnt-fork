%description
CVSNT (Concurrent Version System) is a version control system which can
record the history of your files (usually, but not always, source
code). CVSNT only stores the differences between versions, instead of
every version of every file you've ever created. CVSNT also keeps a log
of who, when and why changes occurred.

CVSNT is very helpful for managing releases and controlling the
concurrent editing of source files among multiple authors. Instead of
providing version control for a collection of files in a single
directory, CVSNT provides version control for a hierarchical collection
of directories consisting of revision controlled files.  These
directories and files can then be combined together to form a software
release.

Install the cvsnt package if you need to use a version control system.

CVSNT is much improved from the older CVS and now has many modern
version control features.  See http://www.march-hare.com/cvspro
